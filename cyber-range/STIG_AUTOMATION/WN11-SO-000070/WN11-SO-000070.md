# 🛡️ Step By Step STIG Automation for STIG ID: WN11-SO-000070

## ℹ️ Overview

This lab was carried out in The Cyber Range, an Azure-hosted enterprise environment where I replicate real-world detection, investigation, and remediation workflows. In this scenario, I focused on STIG automation using PowerShell combined with Tenable authenticated scanning.

To create a realistic compliance and remediation exercise, I deliberately disabled the Windows Firewall on a Windows 11 Pro virtual machine. I then worked through a structured STIG implementation lifecycle that mirrors how compliance controls are identified, validated, and enforced in an enterprise environment.

The workflow included:
- Scanning the VM with a Windows 11 STIG Audit Policy
- Reviewing scan results and selecting a failed STIG (WN11-SO-000070)
- Implementing the STIG manually and validating success
- Reverting the fix to confirm failure
- Automating the remediation using PowerShell
- Re-scanning to confirm successful enforcement

Through this lab, I demonstrate my ability to interpret STIG requirements, manually validate security controls, translate policy guidance into registry-level configuration changes, and automate compliance enforcement using PowerShell.

### 2️⃣ Disable the Windows Firewall

To simulate a misconfigured system commonly encountered in real environments, I disabled the Windows Firewall on the virtual machine.

### 3️⃣ Create an Advanced Network Scan and Run a Baseline Scan

I logged into Tenable Vulnerability Management and created a new scan using a User Defined template scan.

- Scanner: LOCAL-SCAN-ENGINE-01
- Target: VM private IP address (10.0.0.146)

<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-10 144503.png" width="750">
</p>

I configured the scan with Windows credentials for authenticated access and added Compliance Checks for DISA Windows 11 STIG v2r4.

To ensure the scan focused only on STIG compliance and completed quickly:
- All vulnerability plugins were disabled
- Only Policy Compliance → Windows Compliance Checks were enabled

I then ran the initial baseline scan.

### 4️⃣ Investigate Scan Results and Identify the STIG

After reviewing the scan results, I identified a failed STIG: WN11-SO-000070.

According to stigaview.com, Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and must be locked when unattended. The screen saver must be set at a maximum of 15 minutes and be password protected. This protects critical and sensitive data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer.

### 5️⃣ Manually Apply the STIG and Verify the Fix

To manually apply STIG WN11-SO-000070, Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit" to "900" seconds" or less, excluding "0" which is effectively disabled.

After applying the change, I restarted the VM and ran the scan again to validate the fix.

### 6️⃣ Revert the Fix and Confirm Failure

Once the STIG passed successfully, I reverted the configuration to confirm the control would fail again, except this time I did it via regedit.

### Steps to Apply via Regedit
1. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type regedit and press Enter.
3. Navigate to the following path in the Registry Editor:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\
4. In the right-hand pane, look for a value named InactivityTimeoutSecs.
	- If it exists, double-click it.
	- If it does not exist, right-click on the right-hand pane, select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value, and name it `InactivityTimeoutSecs`.
5. In the Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value window, ensure Decimal is selected under Base.
6. Enter a value of 900 or less in the "Value data" field to meet the STIG requirement of a 15-minute (900 seconds) limit.
7. Click OK to save the changes.
8. Close the Registry Editor and reboot the system for the change to take full effect.

I then re-ran the scan.

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-17 173639.png" width="750">
</p>

This confirmed that the STIG failed once more, validating both detection accuracy and remediation effectiveness.

### 7️⃣ Generate and Apply the PowerShell Remediation

After validating the manual fix, I translated the STIG requirements into an automated PowerShell remediation script.

The script was designed to:

- Verify the required registry path exists (HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System) and create it if needed
- Create or update the `InactivityTimeoutSecs` DWORD value
Enforce a STIG-compliant timeout of 900 seconds (15 minutes) or less, explicitly avoiding 0 (disabled)
- Refresh policy (gpupdate) and recommend a reboot so the setting is consistently applied
- Align directly with STIG ID WN11-SO-000070 (“Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit”)

I reviewed the script to ensure it matched the manual configuration steps and prepared it for testing.

To test the automation:

- I logged back into the VM
- Downloaded the PowerShell remediation script from my GitHub repository
- Ran the script in an elevated PowerShell session

Before remediation:

After remediation:

### 8️⃣ Confirm STIG Compliance via Re-Scan

After applying the PowerShell script, I ran another authenticated compliance scan in Tenable.

<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-17 180911.png" width="750">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-18 094443.png" width="750">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-18 094634.png" width="750">  
</p>

The scan confirmed that STIG WN11-SO-000070 was successfully applied and passed, demonstrating that the automated remediation was effective.

### 9️⃣ Conclusion

This lab demonstrates a complete STIG suggesting, validation, and automation lifecycle. By manually implementing, reverting, and then automating the STIG control, I validated both my understanding of DISA STIG requirements and my ability to enforce them programmatically.

This workflow reflects real-world compliance operations where security controls must be validated manually, automated reliably, and continuously verified through authenticated scanning.
