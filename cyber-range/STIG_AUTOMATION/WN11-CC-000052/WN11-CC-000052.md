# 🛡️ Step By Step STIG Automation for STIG ID: WN11-CC-000052

## ℹ️ Overview

This lab was carried out in The Cyber Range, an Azure-hosted enterprise environment where I replicate real-world detection, investigation, and remediation workflows. In this scenario, I focused on STIG automation using PowerShell combined with Tenable authenticated scanning.

To create a realistic compliance and remediation exercise, I deliberately disabled the Windows Firewall on a Windows 11 Pro virtual machine. I then worked through a structured STIG implementation lifecycle that mirrors how compliance controls are identified, validated, and enforced in an enterprise environment.

The workflow included:
- Scanning the VM with a Windows 11 STIG Audit Policy
- Reviewing scan results and selecting a failed STIG (WN11-CC-000052)
- Implementing the STIG manually and validating success
- Reverting the fix to confirm failure
- Automating the remediation using PowerShell
- Re-scanning to confirm successful enforcement

Through this lab, I demonstrate my ability to interpret STIG requirements, manually validate security controls, translate policy guidance into registry-level configuration changes, and automate compliance enforcement using PowerShell.

### 2️⃣ Disable the Windows Firewall

To simulate a misconfigured system commonly encountered in real environments, I disabled the Windows Firewall on the virtual machine.

### 3️⃣ Create an Advanced Network Scan and Run a Baseline Scan

I logged into Tenable Vulnerability Management and created a new scan using a User Defined template scan.

- Scanner: LOCAL-SCAN-ENGINE-01
- Target: VM private IP address (10.0.0.116)

<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-22 142157.png" width="750">
</p>

I configured the scan with Windows credentials for authenticated access and added Compliance Checks for DISA Windows 11 STIG v2r4.

To ensure the scan focused only on STIG compliance and completed quickly:

- All vulnerability plugins were disabled
- Only Policy Compliance → Windows Compliance Checks were enabled

I then ran the initial baseline scan.

### 4️⃣ Investigate Scan Results and Identify the STIG

After reviewing the scan results, I identified a failed STIG: WN11-CC-000052.

According to stigaview.com, Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. By default Windows uses ECC curves with shorter key lengths first. Requiring ECC curves with longer key lengths to be prioritized first helps ensure more secure algorithms are used.

### 5️⃣ Manually Apply the STIG and Verify the Fix

To manually apply STIG WN11-CC-000052, Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Network >> SSL Configuration Settings >> "ECC Curve Order" to "Enabled" with "ECC Curve Order:" including the following in the order listed:

NistP384
NistP256

</p>

After applying the change, I restarted the VM and ran the scan again to validate the fix.

### 6️⃣ Revert the Fix and Confirm Failure

To confirm that the STIG compliance result was directly tied to the ECC Curve Order configuration, I manually reverted the setting using the Windows Registry Editor.

---

### Open Registry Editor
- Press **Windows key + R** to open the Run dialog box  
- Type `regedit` and press **Enter**

---

### Navigate to the ECC Configuration Key
In Registry Editor, navigate to the following path:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Cryptography\Configuration\SSL\00010002
```

---

### Revert the ECC Curve Order Configuration
- In the right-hand pane of the `00010002` key, locate the value named **EccCurves**
- **EccCurves** is a `REG_MULTI_SZ` value that defines the enforced ECC curve order
- Right-click **EccCurves** and select **Delete**
- Confirm the deletion

Deleting the **EccCurves** value removes the explicitly configured ECC curve order and returns the policy to a **Not Configured** (non-compliant) state.

</p>

---

### Apply the Changes
- Close the Registry Editor  
- Restart the system to ensure the change is fully applied  

---

### Validate Failure
After rebooting, I re-ran the authenticated STIG compliance scan. As expected, the ECC Curve Order STIG returned to a failed state, confirming that the control is enforced through registry-based configuration and can be reverted without using the Local Group Policy Editor.

As expected, STIG WN11-CC-000052 returned to a failed state, confirming that the control is enforced entirely through registry-based Group Policy values.

### 7️⃣ Generate and Apply the PowerShell Remediation

After validating the manual fix, I translated the STIG requirements into an automated PowerShell remediation script.

This control is enforced through registry-based Group Policy values and local system cryptographic settings, so the script was designed to configure the required ECC Curve Order programmatically rather than relying on the Local Group Policy Editor.

The script was designed to:

- Enforce a STIG-compliant ECC Curve Order configuration  
- Configure the approved elliptic curves in the required order (NistP384, followed by NistP256)  
- Apply the configuration at the registry-based Group Policy level to ensure policy enforcement  
- Apply the configuration at the local Schannel ECC level to ensure consistent system behavior  
- Create required registry paths if they do not already exist  
- Verify the effective configuration after applying the changes  
- Recommend a system reboot to ensure cryptographic providers fully apply the updated settings  

---

### To test the automation:

- I logged back into the virtual machine  
- Downloaded the PowerShell remediation script from my GitHub repository  
- Ran the script in an elevated PowerShell session


Before remediation:

### 8️⃣ Confirm STIG Compliance via Re-Scan

After applying the PowerShell script, I ran another authenticated compliance scan in Tenable.

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-23 161437.png" width="750">  
</p>

The scan confirmed that STIG WN11-AC-000052 was successfully applied and passed, demonstrating that the automated remediation was effective.

### 9️⃣ Conclusion

This lab demonstrates a complete STIG suggesting, validation, and automation lifecycle. By manually implementing, reverting, and then automating the STIG control, I validated both my understanding of DISA STIG requirements and my ability to enforce them programmatically.

This workflow reflects real-world compliance operations where security controls must be validated manually, automated reliably, and continuously verified through authenticated scanning.
