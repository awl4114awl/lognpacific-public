# 🛡️ Step By Step STIG Automation for STIG ID: WN11-AU-000500

## ℹ️ Overview

This lab was carried out in The Cyber Range, an Azure-hosted enterprise environment where I replicate real-world detection, investigation, and remediation workflows. In this scenario, I focused on STIG automation using PowerShell combined with Tenable authenticated scanning.

To create a realistic compliance and remediation exercise, I deliberately disabled the Windows Firewall on a Windows 11 Pro virtual machine. I then worked through a structured STIG implementation lifecycle that mirrors how compliance controls are identified, validated, and enforced in an enterprise environment.

The workflow included:
- Scanning the VM with a Windows 11 STIG Audit Policy
- Reviewing scan results and selecting a failed STIG (WN11-AU-000500)
- Implementing the STIG manually and validating success
- Reverting the fix to confirm failure
- Automating the remediation using PowerShell
- Re-scanning to confirm successful enforcement

Through this lab, I demonstrate my ability to interpret STIG requirements, manually validate security controls, translate policy guidance into registry-level configuration changes, and automate compliance enforcement using PowerShell.

## 📓 Lab Workflow

### 1️⃣ Provision the Windows 11 Virtual Machine

I provisioned a Windows 11 Pro virtual machine in Microsoft Azure using the Cyber Range infrastructure.

| Component | Details |
|---------|--------|
| VM Name | Windows-11-STIG-vm |
| OS Image | Windows 11 25H2 Pro |
| Region | East US 2 |
| VM Size | Standard DS1 v2 (1 vCPU, 3.5 GiB RAM) |
| Security Type | Trusted Launch (Secure Boot + vTPM Enabled) |
| Network | Cyber-Range-VNet / Cyber-Range-Subnet |
| Public IP | 172.176.197.84 |
| Private IP | 10.0.0.170 |
| Disk Encryption | Disabled |
| Auto-Shutdown | Not Enabled |
| Extensions | AzurePolicyforWindows |

### 2️⃣ Disable the Windows Firewall

To simulate a misconfigured system commonly encountered in real environments, I disabled the Windows Firewall on the virtual machine.

### 3️⃣ Create an Advanced Network Scan and Run a Baseline Scan

I logged into Tenable Vulnerability Management and created a new Advanced Network Scan.

- Scanner: LOCAL-SCAN-ENGINE-01
- Target: VM private IP address (10.0.0.170)

<p align="left">

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-10 144635.png" width="750">
</p>

I configured the scan with Windows credentials for authenticated access and added Compliance Checks for DISA Windows 10 STIG v3r1.

To ensure the scan focused only on STIG compliance and completed quickly:
- All vulnerability plugins were disabled
- Only Policy Compliance → Windows Compliance Checks were enabled

I then ran the initial baseline scan.

### 4️⃣ Investigate Scan Results and Identify the STIG

After reviewing the scan results, I identified a failed STIG: WN11-AU-000500.

<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-11 095757.png" width="750">
</p>

According to stigaview.com, inadequate Application Event Log size can cause audit logs to fill quickly, preventing security-relevant events from being recorded and requiring frequent administrative intervention.

</p>

---

### 5️⃣ Manually Apply the STIG and Verify the Fix

To manually apply STIG WN11-AU-000500, the Application Event Log maximum size must be configured to 32,768 KB (32 MB) or greater.

This can be accomplished through Group Policy:
- Computer Configuration
- Administrative Templates
- Windows Components
- Event Log Service
- Application
- Specify the maximum log file size (KB)
- Set the value to 32768 or higher

<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-11 104757.png" width="750">
</p>

Alternatively, the same setting can be enforced through the registry by modifying:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application
Value Name: MaxSize (REG_DWORD)
Value Data: 32768 or greater

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-11 105300.png" width="750">
</p>

After applying the change, I restarted the VM and ran the scan again to validate the fix.

### 6️⃣ Revert the Fix and Confirm Failure

Once the STIG passed successfully, I reverted the configuration to confirm the control would fail again.

I disabled the Group Policy setting:
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Event Log Service → Application → Specify the maximum log file size (KB)

<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-11 121934.png" width="750">
</p>

I then re-ran the scan.

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-11 134645.png" width="750">
</p>

This confirmed that the STIG failed once more, validating both detection accuracy and remediation effectiveness.

### 7️⃣ Generate and Apply the PowerShell Remediation

After validating the manual fix, I translated the STIG requirements into an automated PowerShell remediation script.

The script was designed to:
- Create the required registry path if it does not exist
- Set the MaxSize DWORD value to 32768 KB or greater
- Enforce the setting persistently
- Align directly with STIG ID WN11-AU-000500

I reviewed the script to ensure it matched the manual configuration steps and prepared it for testing.

To test the automation:
- I logged back into the VM
- Downloaded the PowerShell remediation script from my GitHub repository
- Ran the script in an elevated PowerShell session

Before remediation:

### 8️⃣ Confirm STIG Compliance via Re-Scan

After applying the PowerShell script, I ran another authenticated compliance scan in Tenable.

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-15 081552.png" width="750">  
</p>

The scan confirmed that STIG WN11-AU-000500 was successfully applied and passed, demonstrating that the automated remediation was effective.

### 9️⃣ Conclusion

This lab demonstrates a complete STIG suggesting, validation, and automation lifecycle. By manually implementing, reverting, and then automating the STIG control, I validated both my understanding of DISA STIG requirements and my ability to enforce them programmatically.

This workflow reflects real-world compliance operations where security controls must be validated manually, automated reliably, and continuously verified through authenticated scanning.
